ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
We have been using many kinds of Attendance Management Systems in schools, colleges and universities. Many of the present attendance management systems use the conventional systems for maintaining data and fetching data. In Conventional Systems, we cannot determine the authenticity of the databases. So using a decentralized system could be a solution for this. Blockchain system is distributed and decentralized that make it can be applied to develop a tamper proof-employee attendance system. Conventional Systems do not have the feature to detect whether any particular records have experienced any unauthorized changes. On contrast, using Blockchain technology, no person can deny that he did changes to the database. The blockchain-based employee attendance system is required to provide a database that keeps its reliability and integrity and tamper proof. The control lies in every person that can access the Blockchain. But to make changes in it, every person has to accept the changes. So it is distributed and decentralized but at the same time more secure than the conventional systems. 

WORKFLOW

A) STEPS OF EXECUTION:
1)	Writing the code in Solidity programming language.
2)	Testing it using Remix Ethereum IDE with the help of Metamask.
3)	Once it is working efficiently, Install NPM and then install Web3.js in the local computer. 
4)	Now develop a html page that is used to interact with the smart contract using appropriate buttons for getter and setter functions in the smart contract. Develop a .css file for appropriate styling.
5)	Initialize the local node using the command  “testrpc”
6)	Deploy the smart contract in the local node http provider “http://localhost:8545” by selecting the “Web3 Provider” as the environment.
7)	Now copy the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and paste  in the  html file. 
8)	Copy the hash value of the address where the Smart Contract was deployed. 
9)	Test different features of Attendance Management System by opening the html file in a browser.
